- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
  In order to explicitly take advantage of the component lifecycle methods and to keep state in one object if desired.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
  render() - used when creating components and mounting them to the DOM.
  componentDidUpdate() - used when updating components.
  setState() - modifies and sets state.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
  To build functionality specific to your app.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
  To make sure our components are acting as they should, and also to prevent unwanted side effects throughout our apps.
